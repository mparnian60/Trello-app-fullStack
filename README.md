# PROJECT #2 - Fullstack Trello-app
## Project Overview
The Overview of this project was to create a fullstack Trello app. User is able to signup and create a login and save all boards and cards under the login. That helps user to keep all boards and be able to edit the details whenever required. 
At the moment user is just able to delete whole boards includes realted lists and cards and also each individual card.
## TECHNOLOGIES & RESOURCES USED
* Jquery
* Node.js - express
* Mongoose db
* Page.js
* Bootstrap
## CORE REQUIREMENTS
The Core requirements set out for this project where the following:
* **User Login.** Basic User Authentication
## PLANNING & DELIVERABLES
* **Scope -** AIM: The aim of the project is to build a simple project management app for the user.
Features: Creating new board for each project, able to add lists and card to each list. Also cards can be gragged and dropped between lists.
Implementation Period: 2 Weeks
## CHALLENGE ADD-ONS (Achieved)
* **Front-end Framework.** Using Bootstrap for create new board Modal and navigation bar.
## PROBLEMS FACED
* Single Page Application Bias - Throughout some of the earlier days i had kept thinking of this project as a single page app and did not put enough consideration to the routing and ways that each page will link which could have improved my workflow.
* Wireframing to development - After wireframing my idea i had not realised how complex some of the associations and tasks were going to be, and due to this i feel that i did not achieve all my goals.
* JQUERY Framework Conflicts - due to the use of Bootstrap, the lists were not displaying correctly, then i had to use flex rather than Bootstrap to dispaly my lists.
* Had some issue with accessing DOM elements, when it was created dynamically- I learned to use documnet.on rather than (#id).on to be able to activate my buttons which solved my problem. 
## FURTHER IMPROVEMENTS
* Implement edit on Boards, lists and cards
* Deactive buttons if incorrect data type entered
* Implement specific rules for signUp, length of password and what it should be includes
* Give capability to user to choose the background image of each board
* Create a team, invite people to the board and share your board, then more than one user have access to the same board
